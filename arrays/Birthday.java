 *      - Have that person enter the room.
 *      - If that person shares a birthday with someone else in the room, stop;
 *        otherwise repeat.
 *
 *  In each experiment, count the number of people that enter the room. Print
 *  a table that summarizes the results (the count i, the number of times that
 *  exactly i people enter the room, and the fraction of times that i or fewer
 *  people enter the room) for each possible value of i from 1 until the
 *  fraction reaches (or exceeds) 50%.
